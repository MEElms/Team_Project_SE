# The purpose of this project is to design an app as a group. For this project, our app can be based of an existing app, an enhancement to an app that already exists, a new app for an existing website/application, or a completely new and original idea. This app must also have between 5-7 functions that need to be modelled. The next step of our project is to figure out what we want our app to be and to present it. The group name we came up with is Triceratops!
